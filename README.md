# TradingBot
A bot to (eventually) hook up to Binance and run some basic trading algorithms to automatically trade
At the moment it mainly just gets and cleans the data from Binance. 

If possible, ignore any variables that seem to have been named in rage, as Binance have dummy variables they send out in their actual API which breaks everything without a pointless if
